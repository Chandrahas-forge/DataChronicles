    "# Linear Transformations: Preserving Vector Addition and Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of Linear Transformations\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear transformation $T$ is a function between two vector spaces that preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. Formally, for vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$, and scalar $c$:\n",
    "$$ T(\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v}) = T(\\mathbf{u}) + T(\\mathbf{v}) $$\n",
    "$$ T(c \\mathbf{u}) = c T(\\mathbf{u}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of Preserving Vector Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "Preserving vector addition means that the transformation of the sum of two vectors is the same as the sum of their transformations. This property ensures that the linear combination of vectors is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ in 2D space:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",

    "A linear transformation $T$ represented by the matrix:\n",
    "$$ T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",

    "Applying $T$ to $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$:\n",
    "$$ T(\\mathbf{u}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "Sum of the original vectors:\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n",

    "### Audio Example: Zeroing Out One Stereo Channel\n",
    "\n",
    "In audio processing, scaling transformations can be used to manipulate stereo signals. For example, you can zero out one of the stereo channels using matrix multiplication. This code demonstrates the process of generating, transforming, and playing audio signals using Python. The main objective is to show how a linear transformation matrix can be applied to an audio signal, specifically a stereo signal with distinct sounds on each channel. The transformation matrix used in this example scales the left channel and mutes the right channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps and Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate Sine Wave for a Single Channel**:\n",
    "   - The `generate_sine_wave` function creates a sine wave at a specified frequency for a given duration.\n",
    "   - This function is used to generate a simple sine wave at 440 Hz (A4 note) for the left channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Stereo Signal with Different Frequencies**:\n",
    "   - The `generate_stereo_signal` function creates a stereo audio signal by generating sine waves at specified frequencies for the left and right channels.\n",
    "   - In this example, the left channel is set to 440 Hz (A4 note) and the right channel to 880 Hz (A5 note).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Apply Linear Transformation**:\n",
    "   - The `apply_transformation` function applies a linear transformation matrix to the stereo audio signal.\n",
    "   - The transformation matrix \\(\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\\) is used, which scales the left channel by 2 and mutes the right channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Play Audio Signals**:\n",
    "   - The code sequentially plays three audio signals using the `sounddevice` library:\n",
    "     1. **Left Channel Only**: A sine wave at 440 Hz is played on the left channel, with the right channel muted.\n",
    "     2. **Original Stereo Signal**: The original stereo signal with 440 Hz on the left channel and 880 Hz on the right channel is played.\n",
    "     3. **Transformed Stereo Signal**: The transformed stereo signal, where the left channel is amplified and the right channel is muted, is played.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualize Audio Signals**:\n",
    "   - The code uses `matplotlib` to plot the waveforms of the three audio signals for visual comparison:\n",
    "     - **Left Channel Only Signal**\n",
    "     - **Original Stereo Signal**\n",
    "     - **Transformed Stereo Signal**\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, the code demonstrates the effect of applying a linear transformation matrix to an audio signal. The use of distinct frequencies for the left and right channels, and the clear transformation, makes it easy to hear and see the changes in the audio signal."
